What public dataset on GCP has data we can use for the virtual sensor project


GCP - National Water Model

Simulation modeling observed and forecasted streamflow in the US

The data is an unknown file format for me.

Here is some tools which might be able to read them.

ncdump can read the .ncdf files.  It contains station ids and readings.  Trying to find the station id's associated with 
the Richmond, VA area I used this website

https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html

These are the sensors they have

Looking at google maps, the coordinates are approximately 38.850474, -76.079535
Interesting because the coordinates above are positive for longitude

Google maps uses WGS84 system.

Experimentation shows that the longtitude should be a negative number.

The conversion of lat/lon to different coordinate system fails. 8-(

2019-04-03
--------------
John pointed out the method I pulled form wikipedia for converting
from one coordinate system to another is wrong.

Added the gmap capability in jupyter notebooks.

In order to get the API key to be read from environment, need to source 
setenv.sh from the terminal and then start jupyter notebooks.  Starting
up jupyter from within anaconda-navigator fails on osx.  The code
for starting up navigator uses --init-file on the bash that is started up
and thus even if you set the variable in your shell it does not follow.

API docs for the gmaps module are here
https://jupyter-gmaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#module-gmaps.datasets


2019-04-06
--------------
Started working with the regression sample to add tensorboard to a cell
in notebooks.  Did not finish.


2019-04-13
--------------
Loading the greenstream initial set of csv's into bigquery.
Using cloud dataprep to examine the data.

In greenstreams data the "distance" column is number in cm's to water level.
After looking at the data and talking to Jim, we determined this
iteration of data should be tossed.

Experimented with reading the tsv files with tensorflow and converting.
It seemed to choke on .tsv files.

When back to bash and sed to write the tsv files to csv.

SN02042928.csv only has tidal_high values and only for 2018-5-29 to 2018-04-15
SN0204288539.csv  does not have precipitation columns - fix with sed -i "s/$/,,/g" SN0204288539.csv


Some bigquery imports failed on making the same schmea.  I had to specify them 
on some.  The schema is in 'misc' directory.  Use this site to validate 
the JSON https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/  When specifying the schema, make sure
to use `Advanced options` to skip one header row.



2019-04-14
--------------
Added new tables for usgs which have lat,long columns and data from station id notes.

sql
update `tf-hackathon-236400.usgs_with_latlong.SN0204288539_v2` 
set lat = 100.1
where usgs=usgs

Odd, but it requires a where clause


2019-04-21
--------------

Regarding usgs data.  The water level readings are in feet.  The prepitation is in inches.

Jim's GS data has the following mods
water level = offset - distance.
This value is in cm.


Imported some of Jim's Data to make a bigquery table.  Using SQL
I could massage his single table into something which looked like
the USGS data.  


Also imported all of his tables into one singe dataprep flow.
This enables global mods and the ability to write out a single 
bigquery table as a result.


With that said, Here is the breakdown of Greenstream stations.

Green_stream/Virginia_beach

To distinguish from usgs in data, these sites will 
be designated as gsvb

To give a unqiue Station ID (SN), I'm using format shown below.

Name                            SN              Lat             Long

When trying to work with DataPrep, noticed there is a lat long combo
of 36.732839, -75.971020
So, one of the sensors moved during data gathering.  I built the
table above by getting  lat, long from the first table in each folder.

The above lat/long combo showed up 2,792 times, but by spot checking
the 2019-04-xx csv files in the various folders listed by location
in gcs I could not find which one it was for.

Since I am trying to simply get this data to merge into the usgs data
I simply cut these 2K rows.

I tried quite a bit to get max, min values by day by site, but 
it kept the 5 min values in table.  Trying to do on a per site
basis and see if I can do it.


Went back and played with it some more and now I can do on
all files in the enitre bucket.

I have downloaded the recipe as a wrange and put in the misc folder.

The dataprep job starts an actuall cloud data flow job, which in turn is
a apache beam job.

It appears to be working.  Odd is that all the checkboxes are solid greebn
but its still running.  Once it pops up and says job complete, it still takes 
a while for the table to show up in bigquery.

Now we have dataset.table usgs_v3.usgs_gsvb_v1 which has the combined data in one table.  This includes
usgs station and greenstream stations.

This is the combind station no and lat long the column which says usgs, should be renamed
to 'owner' so that the values are either usgs or gsvb.  

SELECT distinct usgs, site_no, lat, long FROM `tf-hackathon-236400.usgs_v3.usgs_gsvb_v1` order by usgs

Moved the combined table to csv files so that we can start doing actual ML using TF.

We never plotted the lat longs for usgs.  Today when I plotted them, they are incorrect.  Not sure where the problem
is.  The long values seems to be off for all of them.

Aslo noticed I checked in the api key again.  I have to invalidate and get a new one.


2019-04-21
--------------

Another try on the coordinates.



When I entered the coordinates as is in google maps, it shows China.
When I adjust for -76 it autocorrects to below.  It is showing N and W 
as mods for the coordinates.

double checking the usgs website and google maps shows the locations are identical.
